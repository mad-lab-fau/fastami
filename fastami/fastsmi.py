    """Calculate the Monte-Carlo estimate of the standardized mutual
    information sampling full contingency matrices directly.

    The Standardized Mutual Information (SMI) is defined as

        SMI(U, V) = (MI(U,V) - E(MI(U, V))) / std(MI(U, V)),

    under random permutations of the labels. The SMI can be interpreted as the
    number of standard deviations the observed mutual information is away from
    the expected value. The SMI should be used when comparing multiple clusterings
    via a common ground truth reference. The SMI is approximated via Monte-Carlo
    sampling of full contingency matrices with the corresponding marginals.

    Approach to the Adjustment for Chance in Clustering Comparison Metrics.
    Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence.

    Args:
        labels_true: A clustering of the data into disjoint subsets.
        labels_pred: Another clustering of the data into disjoint subsets.
        seed: The random seed to use.
        precision_goal: Targeted relative or absolute error of the approximation.
            If the relative or the absolute error is smaller than this value, the algorithm stops.
        min_samples: Minimum number of samples to use.

    Returns:
        A tuple of the standardized mutual information and an error estimate.

    Notes:
        The error estimate assumes large sample sizes and can therefore be inaccurate if min_samples is too low.
